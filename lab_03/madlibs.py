The second pig was %ADJECTIVE% and he built a house out of %PNOUN%. But the third little pig was very %ADJECTIVE% and he built his house out of genuine %PNOUN%. Well, one day, a mean old wolf came along and saw the houses. '%SOUND%!' he said, 'I'll %VERB% and I'll %VERB% and I'll blow your house down.' And he blew down the first pig's %NOUN% and the second pig's %NOUN%. The two pigs ran to the third pig's house. Thereupon, the wolf began blowing, but he couldn't blow down the third pig's %ADJECTIVE% house. So he %VERB_PAST% off into the forest and the three %ADJECTIVE% pigs moved to Chicago and went into the sausage business."

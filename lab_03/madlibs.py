The second %ANIMAL% was %ADJECTIVE% and he built a house out of %PNOUN%. But the third little %ANIMAL% was very %ADJECTIVE% and he built his house out of genuine %PNOUN%. Well, one day, a mean old wolf came along and saw the houses. '%SOUND%!' he said, 'I'll %VERB% and I'll %VERB% and I'll blow your house down.' And he blew down the first %ANIMAL%'s %NOUN% and the second %ANIMAL%'s %NOUN%. The two %ANIMAL%s ran to the third %ANIMAL%'s house. Thereupon, the wolf began blowing, but he couldn't blow down the third %ANIMAL%'s %ADJECTIVE% house. So he %VERB_PAST% off into the forest and the three %ADJECTIVE% %ANIMAL%s moved to Chicago and went into the sausage business."
